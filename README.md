# String-Repeating-Function

This is a simple program that repeats a given string a specified number of times, it uses a loop to build the repeated string manually.

How It Works

1.The function repeatStringNumTimes(str, num) takes two arguments:
-str → the string you want to repeat
-num → how many times you want to repeat it
2. A for loop runs from 0 up to num - 1.
3. On each loop iteration, the string is added (+=) to the result.
4. When the loop finishes, the full repeated string is returned.
